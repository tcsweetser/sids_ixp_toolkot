# Pacific SIDS IXP Toolkit
## Implementation Framework for Samoa and Timor-Leste

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This toolkit provides a comprehensive framework for establishing Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) across the Pacific region, with specific adaptations for Samoa and Timor-Leste. The toolkit adopts a three-tiered approach addressing regulatory frameworks, capacity building, and governance models tailored to the unique challenges of small island nations.
