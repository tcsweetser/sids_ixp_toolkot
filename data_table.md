\* Recently graduated from LDC status
\** New Caledonia has high viability factors but is excluded from top rankings due to political status as French territory with different regulatory framework

Notes on IXP Viability Scoring:

The IXP Viability Score (scale: 1-10) is a composite measure based on:

Population size (larger markets favor IXP sustainability)

Internet penetration rates (both mobile and fixed)

Economic indicators (GNI per capita, affordability)

Existing connectivity infrastructure (submarine cables)

Technical readiness (bandwidth availability, IDI index)

Geographic positioning as regional hub

Regulatory environment and independence

Top 3 Recommended Locations for New IXPs:

Excluding nations with existing IXPs and monopoly-controlled markets

Guam - Superior connectivity infrastructure (49.6 Gbps submarine cable bandwidth), high internet penetration rates (96.8% mobile, 67.3% fixed), competitive telecommunications market, and strategic position as a regional hub for Micronesia.

Samoa - Strategic position in Central Polynesia, competitive market structure, reasonable economic indicators, and recent infrastructure investments (20.4 Gbps submarine cable bandwidth) make it viable as a regional hub.

Northern Mariana Islands - Strong connectivity metrics (28.5 Gbps submarine cable bandwidth), high penetration rates (91.2% mobile, 53.8% fixed), and proximity to Guam creating potential for a coordinated Micronesian network hub.

Alternative Candidates:

Federated States of Micronesia - Competitive market with multiple providers, strategic central position in Micronesia, though limited by lower penetration rates and bandwidth.

Palau - Non-monopoly market with moderate technical readiness, though limited by smaller population size.

Existing IXPs in the Pacific:

Fiji has FINIX (Fiji Internet Exchange)

Papua New Guinea has PNG-IXP (Papua New Guinea Internet Exchange Point)

Notes on Monopoly Markets:

Several Pacific nations operate under monopoly or effective monopoly conditions, including French Polynesia (OPT), Solomon Islands (Our Telekom), Tonga (Digicel dominant), American Samoa (ASTCA), Marshall Islands (NTA), Cook Islands (Vodafone), Vanuatu (TVL), and others with single-provider markets.
